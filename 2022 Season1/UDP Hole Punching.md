# UDP Hole Punching

ðŸ’¡ **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**:Â a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet

# P2P (Peer-to-Peer)

- each computer acts as both a server and a client
- communicate without any server between them
- should know each otherâ€™s ip address and port number
- Mostly p2p is implemented by UDP than TCP, because itâ€™s faster

- Luckily these days we all have **router** in our homes to connect multiple devices on the internet
- And here we confront some problem with NAT

ðŸ’¡ **NAT: Network Address Translation**
Method of mapping an IP address space into another to communicate between inner-outer network
Converts private ip â†”Â public ip

# Problem (thanks to NATðŸ˜ˆ)

- We have to know each otherâ€™s ip and port number! (which is not private)

- We need `Relay server` which only transfers packet to another

![Untitled](https://t1.daumcdn.net/cfile/tistory/13749E394F0A5BEA25)

- Send a packet to relay server to get public ip and port of device
  - NAT maps public â†”Â private ip address and stores on table

- Now two users can communicate with each other with their public address
- Seems a **hole** has been made!

# Consider

- Has to continuously `ping` to maintain the mapped NAT table
- Because UDP is unreliable, relay server have to consider reliability for better performance
